## Personal

I also have some personal projects:

### SusannaP2018.github.io

### Degree Project
For my CS Degree I applied DevOps technologies (**Terraform, Kubernetes, Gitlab CI/CD, Docker**) to an existing software project for the purpose of evaluating an architectural pattern's readiness for the DevOps methodology.
